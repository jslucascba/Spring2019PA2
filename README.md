# Spring2019PA2
Congratulations!  You’ve been contracted by an international hotel to build a new application to manage functions within the hotel.

While this app will eventual service all of the hotels needs, this project will focus on 2 primary functions – currency exchange and restaurant point of sale.  Even within those systems, phase I will focus on building only the basic features.
